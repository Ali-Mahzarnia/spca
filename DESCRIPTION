Title: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: N. Benjamin Erichson, Peng Zheng, and Sasha Aravkin

Description: Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) attempts to find sparse weight vectors (loadings), i.e., a weight vector with only a few 'active' (nonzero) values. This approach provides better interpretability for the principal components in high-dimensional data settings. This is, because the principal components are formed as a linear combination of only a few of the original variables. This package provides efficient routines to compute SPCA. Specifically, a variable projection solver is used to compute the sparse solution. In addition, a fast randomized accelerated SPCA routine and a robust SPCA routine is provided. Robust SPCA allows to capture grossly corrupted entries in the data.
